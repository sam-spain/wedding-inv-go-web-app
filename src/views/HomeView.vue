          "What a crazy day this was. I suggested we start small and simple with a hot drink in the city centre. In the
          end we walked and talked all across town! The spark between us was pretty clear and the days following it were
          like nothing I had ever experienced." - Sam

          "We decided to meet up at Cafe Nero in Victoria's Square, a public safe place to meet up. The very first statement he blurted out was not hello or good day, but "OH MY GOD! You're so short!!". Thinking about it makes me chuckle even now. " - Karen

          the beautiful Philippines together. I had already loved pinoy cuisine before but this holiday was just heaven
          for me for food. Huge culture shocks for sure but I gained a much deeper appreciation for the culture." - Sam

          "There were a lot of first times for Sam during the holiday from the first stomach bug to riding his first zipline. Most importantly, first time meeting my parents and family in Cebu City. All of them boys even went on a little fishing trip. My family loved him so much because they can see how happy I am around Sam. We went to Camotes Island for a whole family trip touring beaches and caves. Then, both of us went on a trip to Malapascua Island and Kalanggaman Island. Honestly, Sam enjoyed the trips to different islands, but I think he enjoyed mostly the food trip especially Sugbo Mercado." - Karen

          "It was after our second holiday in the Philippines in November 2019 that I started thinking about our life
          together. I had even looked at rings just before the holiday and finally bought one in January. The right
          moment to propose presented itself pretty quickly! Karen was already so happy that night and had been having a
          great time with her friends so I made a speech during the night and read it out when I finally had mustered up
          the courage to propose." - Sam

          "It was the night of my leaving do. Due to the pandemic, my Filipino ICU teammates didn't get the chance to have a Christmas gathering so we ended up doing it during my leaving do. All of us had a wonderful dinner at The Minerva then went to continue the celebration at Ate Lynette and Kuya Arlie's house. Everyone was having a good time with food, drinks, and the best entertainment Karaoke! No one had any clue as to what will happen next. Then, Sam said to me he's going to make a speech so the karaoke mic was passed to him. Everyone thought it was only a cheesy thank you speech until he said "I stopped myself asking questions instead I have only one question to ask, Will you marry me?". Everyone was screaming at the top of their lungs! Of course, I said yes!" - Karen

For better or worse we had Sofia during the heights of covid which meant no friends or family could help us while Karen was in hospital. I only got to visit 1 hour each day for the 10 days Karen was there. Both Karen and Sofia fought hard to get well enough to leave the hospital which made an unforgettable 2 passanger drive home." - Sam

In the end, we have overcome such challenged. Sofia is beautiful in every aspect." - Karen
